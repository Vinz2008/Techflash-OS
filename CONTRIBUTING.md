# Looking to contribute to Techflash OS?

Well go right ahead! &nbsp;I gladly accept new pull requests.  
However, they must follow a few basic rules:
 - Keep it clean: Nothing inappropriate, I'm not going to go into detail here, but the following should be fairly fine, although I have the final decision if it's good or not:
	- Nothing political: Fairly obvious, Techflash OS has nothing to do with politics.
	- Nothing illegal: Also obvious.
	- Nothing NSFW: Not entirely sure how you would even make this happen, but don't.
	- Nothing with extreme swearing: Something like `// Damn, this is some shitty code!  This needs to be redone.` is perfectly fine, just don't go crazy.
 - Follow the style guides [for C](style/style.c), [shell scripts](style/style.sh), and [Makefiles](style/Makefile).  If your code doesn't meet the style guidelines, you will be given a one time warning, and I'll fix it myself. &nbsp;If you decide to commit more changes, and they still don't meet the guidelines, you will be asked to fix it and recommit.
 - And lastly, but most importantly:
	- Credit yourself! &nbsp;I don't want to be taking credit for your code, and you deserve some recognition for your work!
