- Binary format for symbol table?
	+ uint8_t magic[4] ('S', 'Y', 'M', 'T'?) # Magic number to identify that we're in the right place
	? uint8_t flags // bit array of flags?  not sure what this could be used for, but useful nonetheless
	+ uint16_t numSyms # the number of symbols stored in the table
	+ struct {uint64_t addr, char name[]} symbl[numSyms] // a struct with the address, and null terminated symbol name.  This repeats for every symbol
